# brl-fetch
Fastfetch for Bedrock Linux.
This is a small alternative to fastfetch, but just for Bedrock Linux (brl). (This is AI-made, so don't expect any major changes)
# How to use?
1. Install Bedrock Linux, doesn't matter what you hijack, just gotta be anything. I use endeavour for example. And ofcourse, you need python.
2. Install the file and run "chmod +x brlfetch_installer.py", afterwards just run "./brlfetch_installer.py"
3. This is going to put a "brlfetch" file on your ~/.local/bin.
4. Follow the instructions on the installer
5. CD into ~/.local/bin and run brlfetch!
If anyone knows how I can make the shortcut global, please tell me!
